# IAIK jTSS - Java TCG Software Stack
# TSS Service Provider (TSP) configuration file
# This configuration file is read by the jTSS TSP.
# Copy it to the same location where the TSP jar file resides.


[PersistentStorage]
# set the type of the persistent storage to use
# uncomment the following line for storing data as simple files
# type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.ps.TcTssUserPsFileSystem
# uncomment the following line for storing data in a database
type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.ps.TcTssUserPsDatabase

[TcTssUserPsFileSystem]
# TODO: if you're using file system persistent storage, set the 
# location for the user persistent storage (TSP level key storage).
# NB: Must not be the same folder as for system persistent storage. 
folder=/var/lib/jtss/user_storage

[TcTssUserPsDatabase]
# TODO: if you're using database persistent storage, set the 
# database path and name of the database persistent storage
# (TSP level key storage).
# The database files will be stored using your desired name and with
# the extensions .log, .script, .log, .data, .backup and .lck
database=/var/lib/jtss/user_storage/keydb

[TcTssUserPsTrousers]
# You only need this if you use the tool to copy the TrouSers
# persistent storage to jTSS.
# Normally this file should be in ~/.trousers
#file=/home/username/.trousers/user.data

[BindingFactory]
#The Trusted Service Provider TSP can access the Trusted Core Service TCS 
#either via local calls or the SOAP interface. 
#The type variable specifies which binding we want to use
#Use 
type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.java.tsp.TcTssLocalCallFactory
#for the local binding, and
# type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.java.tsp.TcTssSOAPCallFactory
#
#for the SOAP binding.
#NOTE: The SOAP binding requires a running Trusted Cores Service!
#      See the "jtss_readme.txt" to start the TCS with SOAP support. 


[SOAP]
#The Trusted Core Services TCS can provide access for the Trusted Service Providers TSP 
#either via local calls or the SOAP interface. For the soap server module, a socket can
#be configured. The default is 30003 as specified by the TCG.   
portnumber=30004

#Specify the relative path within the AXIS Server that hosts the TCS Service.
relativepath=/axis/services/TSSCoreServiceBindingImpl

#If you want to use a remote host to connect to, you have to set the variable 
#"useRemoteHost" explicitly to the value "true". If and only if this value is set
#we evaluate the variable "host". Otherwise, we use the localhost, i.e. 127.0.0.1.
useremotehost=false
remotehost=http://127.0.0.1
