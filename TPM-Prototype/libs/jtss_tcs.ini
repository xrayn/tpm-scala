# IAIK jTSS - Java TCG Software Stack
# TSS Core Services (TCS) configuration file
# This configuration file is read by the jTSS TCS.
# Copy it to the same location where the TCS jar file resides.


[PersistentStorage]
# set the type of the persistent storage to use
# uncomment the following line for storing data as simple files
# type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.ps.TcTssSystemPsFileSystem
# uncomment the following line for storing data in a database
type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.ps.TcTssSystemPsDatabase

[EventManager]
# set the type of event manager you want to use
# uncomment the following line for using a in-memory event manager
# type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.java.tcs.eventmgr.TcTcsEventMgrMem
# uncomment the following line for using a text file based event manager
#type=iaik.tc.tss.impl.java.tcs.eventmgr.TcTcsEventMgrFlatFile

[TcTssSystemPsFileSystem]
# TODO: if you're using file system persistent storage, set the 
# location for the system persistent storage (TCS level key storage).
# NB: Must not be the same folder as for user persistent storage.
folder=/var/lib/jtss/system_storage

[TcTssSystemPsDatabase]
# TODO: if you're using database persistent storage, set the 
# database path and name of the database persistent storage
# (TCS level key storage).
# The database files will be stored using your desired name and with
# the extensions .log, .script, .log, .data, .backup and .lck
database=/var/lib/jtss/system_storage/keydb

[TcTssSystemPsTrousers]
# You only need this if you use the tool to copy the TrouSers
# persistent storage to jTSS.
# Normally this path should be correct, otherwise update it.
# NOTE: You may have to change the access rights of this file.
file=/usr/local/var/lib/tpm/system.data

[TcTcsEventMgrFlatFile]
# Sets the path of the event log file if EventMgrFlatFile is selected.
file=/var/log/jtss/eventlog

[SOAP]
#The Trusted Core Services TCS can provide access for the Trusted Service Providers TSP 
#either via local calls or the SOAP interface. For the soap server module, a socket can
#be configured. The default is 30003 as specified by the TCG.   
portnumber=30004
#This option is just for debugging purposes. If the "debug" options is set to 
#true the TCS writes additional debugging information to the log files.
#If debug is set to false the TCS just reports to the standard output.
debug=true

[TDDL]
# Configure the implementation of the TDDL layer that accesses the TPM device.
# Choose either iaik.tc.tss.impl.java.tddl.TcTddlLinux, iaik.tc.tss.impl.java.tddl.TcTddlVista or iaik.tc.tss.impl.java.tddl.TcTddlSocket.
# Leave empty to enable autodetection (Linux or Windows, default)
TDDLImplementation=

[TDDLLinuxDevice]
# Configure the Linux path to the TPM device, e.g. /dev/tpm0
# Leave empty to enable autodetection (default)
LinuxTpmDevice=

[TDDLSocket]
# Configure the IP adress or hostname and port for the socket to connect to (i.e. IBM's Software TPM)
TPMServerName=localhost
TPMServerPort=30005
